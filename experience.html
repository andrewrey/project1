        <p>Over the years, I've used several resources when I needed to understand specific technologies. Currently I'm working on the TeamTreeHouse tech degree for Front End Web Development, and I'm really enjoying the content. Having videos that provide great examples and good explanations have solidified several things that previously were a bit murky for me.</p>
        <p> One course that I really enjoyed, through my journey of online learning, and covered several areas was <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science" target="_blank">CS50</a> through EdX. This is the Harvard Introduction to Computer Science course, and it really started to get me thinking about switching from working in management to wanting to be a developer myself.</p>
        <p>While working on the Front End Tech Degree, I'm also studying Data Science using Python. This has been extremely beneficial for me, as I can now quickly go through data on spreadsheets and apply python to find relevant information amongst thousands of data points. I feel that learning to use Python for data analysis is a skill that is very valuable in today's work environment. I spent years building, what seemed like neverending, spreadsheets that in the end were not easy to quickly grasp what the numbers were showing me. Now I can give more concrete answers to questions using the data. </p>
