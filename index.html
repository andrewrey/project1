        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> My first real entry into the technolgy field was in 2015. I had been asked to be President of a tech startup that was based out of Vancouver, BC. My job was to build a team that could produce a MVP designed for location tracking of items. </p>
        <p>Prior to this, my focus was on secure logistics, and with having to find and attract software developers it required some serious time learning and understanding tech. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to update my skills in building websites. Previously I would hire web developers to build company pages. Moving forward I would like to have a more active part in helping construct pages. Skills I am currently working on are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>R</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would like to continue working as a consultant, but with adding more web development skills to my list of tools, I would like to be able to apply some of my consulting services to company pages and web resources. </p>
